# Weather-Forecasting---Time-Series

# Overview
This repository contains time series data related to weather forecasting. Weather forecasting is a critical aspect of meteorology and has wide-ranging applications in agriculture, transportation, disaster management, and more. This dataset aims to provide researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts with valuable historical weather data for analysis, modeling, and forecasting purposes.

# Data Description
The dataset includes various meteorological parameters collected at regular intervals over a specific period. Each data point represents a timestamped observation of different weather variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

Timestamp: Date and time of the observation.
Tavg: The average temperature of the day in degrees Celsius (°C).
Tmin: The minimum temperature of the day in degrees Celsius (°C).
Tmax: The maximum temperature of the day in degrees Celsius (°C).
Precipitation: The amount of precipitation in millimeters (mm).

The dataset is organized in a time-series format, with each row representing a specific timestamp and its corresponding weather measurements.

# Data Source
The data is collected from reliable sources such as weather stations, meteorological departments, or online weather APIs. It is important to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data source to maintain the quality of analysis and forecasting models.

# Data Usage
Researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts can utilize this dataset for various purposes, including but not limited to:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand temporal patterns and trends in weather data.
Developing machine learning models for weather forecasting, such as autoregressive models, LSTM networks, or Prophet models.
Evaluating the impact of weather conditions on different sectors, such as agriculture, transportation, energy, and tourism.
Studying climate change trends and their effects on weather patterns over time.
